                Aurora Aksnes, known as AURORA, is a Norwegian, nature inspired singer songwriter, musician, and producer. She is self taught, and started playing the piano at age 6 by figuring out the melodies to her favorite classical songs. She began writing her songs at age 9 when she could speak English well enough to do so. When she wasn't wandering the mountains and fjords of Norway, she was writing songs at the piano, in secret, for herself. One day her parents wanted to hear her sing, and so instead of singing in front of them, she recorded a song for them instead. Somehow that song got uploaded to a streaming site, and she was contacted by her current management shortly after. She declined their offer at first, because she didn't want to be an artist, and perform and travel. Her mother, however, knew that the world needed her music, and encouraged her to take the opportunity.

                Since she embarked on her journey as an artist she's released two EPs, two Albums, and numerous Singles. She was even chosen to be the voice of the North Wind on Disney's "Frozen 2". People love her ability to share her emotional senstitivity through the songs she writes. She sings them in such a way that it empowers people, lifts them up, and shows them how to be an awakened human being. People love the way she lights up a room with her voice, and energizes the whole audience with her movements. They admire the way she emanates love, stands up for her beliefs, and is a voice for the voiceless. She has amassed a fierce and loving fan base she calls "Warriors and Weirdos" whom lifts her up just as much as she lifts them up!
